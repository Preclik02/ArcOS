# ArcOS

**ArcOS** is a Linux Mint-based operating system built and maintained by a 14-year-old solo developer from the Czech Republic – [preclik02](https://github.com/preclik02). It ships with custom tools like the **ArcNull shell** and the **ArcC framework**, both located in the `~/Documents` folder.

## 🔽 Download & Install

To install ArcOS, you can download the ISO directly from Dropbox:

🔗 [Download ArcOS 1.0.0 ISO](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wrrroev2pr2z9v0nvx6q9/ArcOS-1.0.0.iso?e=2&rlkey=xpgk4gwn66bgavfbvmmf4e0vt&st=4yzwjg4m&dl=0)

Burn the ISO to a USB drive using a tool like **Rufus**, **balenaEtcher**, or **Ventoy**, and boot from it to install ArcOS.

> 🛠 A custom frontend/installer is planned for the future.

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

- ✅ Linux Mint base (with default Linux kernel)
- 🐚 **ArcNull** – A beginner-friendly Bash-like shell, written in C++
- ⚙️ **ArcC** – A C-inspired joke framework using `.arc` files
- 🧠 **Arcc** – A compiler pipeline written in Python + C++ with encryption

---

## 📂 Folder Layout

Once installed, ArcOS will place its core tools in:

- `~/Documents/ArcNull` – the shell (must be in your `PATH`)
- `~/Documents/ArcC` – framework and compiler (no path setup needed)

To run ArcNull:

```bash
arcnull
```

> Make sure the ArcNull folder is correctly added to your `PATH`. See the [ArcNull README](https://github.com/Preclik02/ArcOS/tree/main/ArcNull) for instructions.

## 🚧 Development

ArcOS is a hobby project by a single 14y.o. developer, still in progress but frequently updated. Its goal is to offer a fun, weird, and personalized Linux-based environment.

Expect active development in:

- ArcNull terminal
- ArcC (the framework) and Arcc (the compiler)
- System scripts and future GUI
