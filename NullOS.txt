NullOS Documentation and History [I - !]
NullOS started as a fun idea — I wanted to make my own operating system. It was a long-term goal, and I originally planned to start working on it seriously around 18 years old. But I began way earlier.

The first version, NullOS 0.0.1, was a very basic OS that I tested in QEMU — it just printed some text. Unfortunately, I lost the folder when I switched Linux distros during development, but I was happy it worked. That day, I realized how hard it is to build an OS from scratch, so I decided to focus on creating my own Linux-based distro instead. [R - €]

I started with a Manjaro build, thinking creating an ISO from it would be easy. After a few days of preparation, I realized how complicated building an ISO really is, so I switched to Linux Mint. That same day, I managed to get my own shell, IDE, and even a keylogger working.

Even though I almost lost hope building the ISO, I downloaded Cubic and imported my repositories there. Now, the ISO image comes with a preloaded user named null_user with password NullUser. [C - %] [F - *] [G - O]

Downloading NullOS
You can download the NullOS 1.0.0 ISO image here:

NullOS-1.0.0.iso (Dropbox)

The ISO is about 3.8 GB and comes with the full Null ecosystem pre-installed.

Joining the Community and Developer Team [E - []
If you want to join the official NullOS Discord server and potentially become part of the development team, here’s a fun challenge for you: [Q - ]

Find all the hidden letters scattered in the documentation.

Send me two files via email (nulldecode@gmail.com):

The Null alphabet: a mapping of all letters used in NullC encryption (e.g. A - O, but not necessarily correct). [D - ]]

A .null file that is a working NullC program printing "Hello World".

NullC is basically a framework built on top of C, using its own encryption. If you solve this puzzle, I’ll reply and consider inviting you to the team. [X - <>] [Y - Y]

About Null Shell
Null is the shell designed for NullOS. It’s beginner-friendly, bash-based, and has all the commands a new user might need. If you set it up properly by adding it to your shell’s PATH (for bash, this means editing ~/.bashrc, or for zsh, ~/.zshrc), it should work normally.

Some key features:

Run it by typing null in your terminal.

Supports simple package management commands like:

install <package-name> (installs packages with a beginner-friendly interface) [V - .]

update (runs sudo apt update) [N - $]

Use help to see a list of 23+ commands. [M - =]

Type quit to exit Null and return to your standard shell. [H - 8] [Z - 3]

About NullC and Nullc
NullC is a simple framework/language inspired by C but uses its own .null file format. While NullOS itself doesn’t recognize .null files, the NullC compiler (nullc) does.

The nullc command in Null prompts you for a filename (without the .null extension). Under the hood, it runs a pipeline:

A C++ program runs a Python script that decrypts and converts .null files into standard C code.

The C++ program then compiles this C code using gcc. [O - /] [W - ..]

After compiling, the intermediate C file is deleted, leaving you with a clean executable ELF file.

NullC is still a very new and experimental framework, so it’s not suitable for complex projects yet, but it’s a fun and unique way to experiment with encrypted C-like programming. [K - @] [T - tm]

Contact and Support
If you encounter any issues or want to reach out, you can contact me via:

Discord (link in the official server)

Email: nulldecode@gmail.com [A - 4]

I try to respond to everyone as best I can. [B - ()] [P - +] [S - 9]

Final Notes
NullOS is a project maintained by a 14-year-old solo developer from the Czech Republic (preclik02). The repositories save me a lot of time and help me update the ISO frequently.

Currently, the project is free to use and open source. There’s no way to donate because of my age, but I appreciate every bit of support. [J - #]

Thanks for reading the docs, and I’ll keep updating them as NullOS and Null evolve. [L - ?] [U - _]

See you on Discord!
